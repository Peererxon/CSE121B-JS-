I want to build an app that shows Rick and Morty characters using this public API https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation. The content will be initially just photos and names but when the user clicks the card it will show more information about the character.

The project will use fetch to get the data from the API, and once I get the data form the API I will be working with objects. To add more elements I will use a for each and probably a map loop. 

Also, to show more data I will use a filter and then work with the DOM
